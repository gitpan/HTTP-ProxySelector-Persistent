Revision history for HTTP-ProxySelector-Persistent

	- Redid the error structure to make it more perl-
	  friendly.  Most functions return 1 upon success
	  or 0 upon failure, so you can now use them like:
	    $out = $select->method() or die $select->error()
	- Added proxied_get() method.  This for quick single
	  gets that have to same persistence and reliability
	  as the useragent proxy setting method.
	- Changed up the proxy server lists for the tests
	  to make sure that my tests are testing my module,
	  not someone else's list of proxy servers.
	- Made the test 1/2 as tolerant as the useragent for
	  timeouts.  This means that if you set your useragent
	  to time out at 4 seconds, the test times out at 2
	  seconds to be extra sure that the useragent this
	  module returns will perform to the specs you need.
